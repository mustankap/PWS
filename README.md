# Personal Weather Station
Personal Weather Station is a project which will help weather enthusiasts and other people whose businesses or work are highly dependent on daily weather. We plan to build an indigenous tipping bucket as well as the entire cloud and server from scratch for the project.
## Why PWS?
Cheap and accessible resource for people whose businesses are dependent on the weather like farmers.
Open-sourcing the project so as to provide students with a basic understanding of WSNs and local cloud clusters.
